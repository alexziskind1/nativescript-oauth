# OAuth 2 login plugin for NativeScript

![npm-downloads-per-week](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/nativescript-oauth.svg)

This is a modification in the original library that we use to allow multiple login options to the end-user.

The original library only allowed initially with one of Facebook, LinkedIn etc.

Instead of calling init[Provider] at main.ts or app.ts, call it when the end user clicks on the "Login with [Provider]" button and on resolving the promise there, call the login method.

Wrap the logout method with a if (5===5) { tnsOAuthModule.logout()...} so that at run-time, it does not throw an exception.

I've also modified the library so that clicking cancel on the LinkedIn Auth page goes back to the previous webview instead of it attempting to load the linkedIn redirect URL.

Library for interacting with OAuth 2.0 in NativeScript applications that provides simplified client access with a OAuth providers that support the OAuth 2.0 protocol such as Microsoft Live accounts, Microsoft Graph, Office 365, Facebook, Cloud Foundry UAA instances, LinkedIn, and Google (Google is a work in progress due to some of their restrictions).

**_NEW:_** **Now supports NativeScript 4.1.0!**

Tested against Microsoft Live, Office 365, Microsoft Graph API, Facebook, LinkedIn and private instances of UAA.

## Prerequisites

### Office 365 / Microsoft Graph API

For logging in with your Office 365 account, you should have an Office 365 Account admin account. If you don't have one yet, you can get a [free trial here](https://products.office.com/en-us/try).

Watch a [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/nwf928oFGCM) for setting up the NativeScript OAuth plugin and registering you app with Microsoft.

Register your mobile app [here](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com). This will require you to login with your Office 365 account. You can then click the big "Add an app" button and go through the steps listed there, starting with giving you app a name. On the app creation screen, you need to do 3 things:

1.  Click the "Add Platform" button and select "Mobile application"
2.  Copy the "Client Id" GUID from the Mobile Application section.
3.  Click "Save" at the bottom.

### Facebook account

For logging in with your Facebook account, you should have a Facebook developer account. If you don't have one yet, you can get one [here](https://developers.facebook.com/).

Keep an eye out on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexanderZiskind) for a video on how to set up Facebook with with plugin.

Register your mobile app by following the wizard under "My Apps" -> "Add a new app".

1.  Go to https://developers.facebook.com/apps and create a new app
2.  If you see the Product Setup page, select Facebook login
3.  Make sure to turn ON the option "Embedded Browser OAuth Login"
4.  Click Save
5.  Copy the App ID and the App Secret from the Dashboard page to bootstrap your app. These will be the ClientID and CLientSecret respectively.

### LinkedIn Account

For logging in with your LinkedIn account, you should have a LinkedIn developer account. If you don't have one yet, you can get one [here](https://developer.linkedin.com/).

1.  Click on `My Apps` and login with your LinkedIn credentials or click on Join Now to create a new account.
2.  Once logged in click on `Create Application`.
3.  Fill out all fields with the app's information and Click `submit`.
4.  If everything goes well you should get your app's authentication keys which consists of a client id and a client secret.
5.  In this page, make sure to add an `Authorized Redirect URL`. (This can be any url starting with http:// or https://).
6.  Copy the Authentication Keys and the Authorized Redirect URL.

### Cloud Foundry User Account and Authentication (UAA)

You will need to have a Cloud Foundry account to deploy your instance of UAA.

For more information, please refer to https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa

## Setup

Add TypeScript to your NativeScript project if you don't already have it added. While this is not a requirement, it's highly recommended. If you want to watch a video on how to convert your existing JavaScript based NativeScript app to TypeScript, [watch it here](https://youtu.be/2JDXnduTlgs).

From the command prompt go to your app's root folder and execute:

```
npm install nativescript-oauth --save
```

## Usage

If you want a quickstart, you can start with one of two demo apps:

- [TypeScript Demo App](https://github.com/alexziskind1/nativescript-oauth/tree/master/demo)
- [Angular Demo App](https://github.com/alexziskind1/nativescript-oauth/tree/master/demo-angular)

### Bootstrapping

We need to do some wiring when your app starts. If you are not using Angular, open `app.ts` and add the following code before `application.start();`

If you are using Angular, then open your `main.ts` file and add the following code before `platformNativeScriptDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);`

##### TypeScript

```js
import * as tnsOAuthModule from "nativescript-oauth";
```

###### For Office365 login, include the following lines

```js
var o365InitOptions: tnsOAuthModule.ITnsOAuthOptionsOffice365 = {
  clientId: "e392f6aa-da5c-434d-a42d-a0e0a27d3955", //client id for application (GUID)
  scope: ["Files.ReadWrite", "offline_access"] //whatever other scopes you need
};

tnsOAuthModule.initOffice365(o365InitOptions);
```

###### For Facebook login, include the following lines

```js
var facebookInitOptions: tnsOAuthModule.ITnsOAuthOptionsFacebook = {
  clientId: "1119818654921555",
  clientSecret: "bbb58f212b51e4d555bed857171c9aaa",
  scope: ["email"] //whatever other scopes you need
};

tnsOAuthModule.initFacebook(facebookInitOptions);
```

###### For UAA login, include the following lines

```js
var uaaInitOptions: tnsOAuthModule.ITnsOAuthOptionsUaa = {
  authority: "https://my-uaa-instance.com",
  redirectUri: "myAppDomain://authcallback",
  clientId: "my-client-id",
  clientSecret: "my-client-secret",
  scope: ["uaa.resource", "uaa.user"],
  cookieDomains: ["myAppDomain://"],
  basicAuthHeader: "Basic XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
};

tnsOAuthModule.initUaa(uaaInitOptions);
```

###### For LinkedIn login, include the following lines

```js
var linkedInInitOptions: tnsOAuthModule.ITnsOAuthOptionsLinkedIn = {
  clientId: "",
  clientSecret: "",
  scope: ["r_basicprofile"] //Leave blank and the default scopes will be used
};

tnsOAuthModule.initLinkedIn(linkedInInitOptions);
```

###### For Custom OAuth Login, include the following lines

The custom provider is intended for advanced users. It directly exposes the OAuth credentials. You can use this to connect with your own private identity server or other providers.

```js
var myInitOptions : tnsOAuthModule.ITnsOAuthCredentials = {
    authority: 'https://my.identity-server',
    authorizeEndpoint: '/my/authorize/endpoint'
    tokenEndpoint: '/my/token/endpoint',
    clientId: 'myClientId',
    clientSecret: 'my-client-secret,
    redirectUri: 'myAppDomain://callback',
    responseType: 'my tokens',
    scope: 'my requested scopes',
};

tnsOAuthModule.initCustom({
    credentials: myInitOptions,
    cookieDomains: [ 'my.identity-server', ... ],
});
```

### Logging in

In your view controller or component (or wherever you will have a handler to respond to the login user action) you will reference the `nativescript-oauth` module again and call the `login` function.

```js
import * as tnsOAuthModule from 'nativescript-oauth';
...
tnsOAuthModule.login()
    .then(()=>{
        console.log('logged in');
        console.dir("accessToken " + tnsOAuthModule.accessToken());
    })
    .catch((er)=>{
        //do something with the error
    });
```

When you make API calls you can use the `ensureValidToken` function, which will also ask you to authenticate, if the token is expired.

```js
tnsOAuthModule
  .ensureValidToken()
  .then((token: string) => {
    console.log("token: " + token);
  })
  .catch(er => {
    //do something with the error
  });
```

## Contributing

1.  Fork the nativescript-oauth repository on GitHub
1.  Clone your fork
1.  Change directory to `nativescript-oauth`
1.  Run `npm install` in the root folder to install all npm packages for the plugin
1.  Run `tsc` in the root folder to build the plugin TypeScript
1.  Edit the `/demo/package.json` file: `"nativescript-oauth" : "../"` - this will point the demo project to use the local oauth plugin instead of the one hosted on npm.
1.  Run `npm install` in the `demo` folder to install all npm packages for the demo (these are also shared by the plugin, so they are needed to build)
1.  Replace the ClientId in the app.ts file of the demo with your own ClientId
1.  Run the demo project
